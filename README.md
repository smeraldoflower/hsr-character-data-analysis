## **Basic Information**

This project will use a variety of data analysis techniques to analyze character role distributions and demographics across the different factions, elements (types), paths, and roles in *Honkai: Star Rail (video game)*.

The goal is to determine if certain combinations of these are more common or less represented in the game. This information can then be used to predict the characteristics of future characters not yet added into the game.

## **Project Objectives**

*The primary questions this project aims to answer are as follows:*
- How many playable characters are currently in the game (including upcoming characters from official announcements)?
- How many characters were released/will release in each major version update (1.x, 2.x, 3.x)?
- How many characters are of 5-star and 4-star rarity respectively?
- How many characters are male and female respectively?
- How many characters are following each path (Destruction, The Hunt, Erudition, Harmony, Nihility, Preservation, Abundance)?
- How many characters use Physical, Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind, Quantum, and Imaginary types respectively?
- Which path/type has the most/least characters?
- Which path/type has the most/least 5-star/4-star characters?
- Which path/type has the most/least male/female characters?
- What path/type combinations are currently missing among male/female and 5-star/4-star characters?
